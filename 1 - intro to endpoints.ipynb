    "### Introduction to pyNS\n",
    "Hi there! Here we introduce the Neuroscout API, and the basic ways in which you can interact with it using pyNS. \\\n",
    "The API has a number of endpoints (https://neuroscout.org/api/swagger/):\n",
    "- <b>Dataset-related</b> endpoints:\n",
    "    - `Dataset`, through which you can retrieve information about Neurosocut datasets;\n",
    "    - `Task`, through which you can retrieve information about tasks - note that, in Neuroscout, a task defines a \"stimulus\". A dataset can have multiple task, if multiple different stimuli are used within that study;\n",
    "    - `Runs`, through which you can retrieve information about runs. Within a dataset, data could be collected from a subject over multiple runs, where either the same or a different stimulus is used;\n",
    "- <b>Predictor-related</b> endpoints:\n",
    "    - `Predictor`: through which you can query and push information predictors (e.g., pre-extracted stimulu features) available for given runs;\n",
    "    - `Predictor events`: through which, given a predictor id, you can retrieve the value of a given feature at each time point in a run. Events are marked with an `onset` and a `duration`, and the onset is defined relative to the start of the fMRI acquisition (e.g., onset=0.0 means that a given event happens at the same time as the trigger);\n",
    "- <b>Analysis-related</b> endpoints:\n",
    "    - `Analysis`, through which you can retrieve, modify, compile, push analyses and get reports;\n",
    "- <b>User-related</b> endpoints:\n",
    "    - `User`, through which you can interact with you user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how each of these works, and how the output looks like - before jumping into specific use cases in the next notebooks. Let's start!"

    "### Authentication\n",
    "To interact with the Neuroscout API, you first need to authenticate. If you don't have an account, go to https://neuroscout.org, click on the `Sign up` button in the top left corner.\n",
    "Once you've created one, you can sign up with the command below. Replace `email` and `password` with your own."
